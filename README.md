Small CRUD web application to help you create and organize your own personal
library. Made with Spring Framework 5 for backend logic, Thymeleaf for view and
MySQL as database.<br/>
With this app you can view, edit, add and delete books in your library. All changes
you've made are saved in the database. This application implements classical
Model-View-Controller pattern, where data is presented to user through browser,
data processing and business logic are made on the server and information is saved in
persistent storage.
